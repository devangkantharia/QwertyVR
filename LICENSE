		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991


Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                   675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			    Preamble

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
   charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
   table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
   the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
   is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
   in the event an application does not supply such function or
   table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
   its purpose remains meaningful.

   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
   a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
   application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
   application-supplied function or table used by this function must
   be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
   root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
   machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
   changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
   Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
   with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
   uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
   user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
   executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
   that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
   Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
   to use the modified definitions.)

   b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
   least three years, to give the same user the materials
   specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
   than the cost of performing this distribution.

   c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
   specified materials from the same place.

   d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
   materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

   <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
   Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

   This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
   modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
   License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
   version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
   Library General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
   License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
   Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
 library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

 <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
 Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

Oculus VR Rift SDK Software License

Oculus VR, LLC Software Development Kit License Agreement

Copyright © 2014 Oculus VR, LLC. All rights reserved.

The text of this may be found at: http://www.oculusvr.com/licenses/LICENSE-3.2

Human-Readable Summary*:

You are Free to:

Use, modify, and distribute the Oculus VR Rift SDK in source and binary
form with your applications/software.

With the Following Restrictions:

You can only distribute or re-distribute the source code to LibOVR in
whole, not in part.

Modifications to the Oculus VR Rift SDK in source or binary form must
be shared with Oculus VR.

If your applications cause health and safety issues, you may lose your
right to use the Oculus VR Rift SDK, including LibOVR.

The Oculus VR Rift SDK may not be used to interface with unapproved commercial
virtual reality mobile or non-mobile products or hardware.

* - This human-readable Summary is not a license. It is simply a convenient
reference for understanding the full Oculus VR Rift SDK License Agreement.
The Summary is written as a user-friendly interface to the full Oculus VR Rift
SDK License below. This Summary itself has no legal value, and its contents do
not appear in the actual license.

Full-length Legal Copy:

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the "License"),
Oculus VR, LLC ("Oculus VR") hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, sublicenseable copyright license to use,
reproduce, redistribute (subject to restrictions below), modify, and improve the
software contained in this Oculus VR Rift Software Development Kit ("RIFT SDK"),
including, but not limited to, the samples, headers, LibOVR headers, and LibOVR
source.  This license is subject to the following terms and conditions:

1.1. This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use (i) the RIFT
SDK to make applications, content, games and demos (collectively and generally
referred to as "Developer Content") that run on the Oculus VR approved mobile hardware
and software products ("Oculus Approved Rift Products") and which may incorporate
the RIFT SDK in whole or in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the
RIFT SDK to create derivative works of the RIFT SDK itself ("RIFT SDK Derivatives"),
whether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part, including third
party software unless otherwise noted.

1.2.  RIFT SDK Derivatives are further defined as source, binary or object code
derived exclusively from the RIFT SDK by you; provided, however, that RIFT SDK
Derivatives do not include the Developer Content (engines, utilities, applications,
content, games or demos) which may be developed using the RIFT SDK.  By way of example
a mobile application or game or demo that is developed using the RIFT SDK would not
be a RIFT SDK Derivative , nor would a utility or tool set in a pre-existing game
engine that is adapted to work with the RIFT SDK be a RIFT SDK Derivative.
By way of example, but not limitation, a RIFT SDK Derivative is or would be: either (i)
an adaptation of a utility or piece of code from the RIFT SDK to improve efficiency;
or (ii) an addition of code or improvement to the RIFT SDK that adds functionality.

1.3  For the sake of clarification when you use the RIFT SDK (including RIFT SDK
Derivatives) in or with Developer Content, you retain all rights to your Developer
Content, and you have no obligations to share or license Developer Content (including
your source and object code) to Oculus VR or any third parties; provided, however,
Oculus VR retains all rights to the RIFT SDK and the RIFT SDK Derivatives that may
be incorporated into your Developer Content.

1.4  You agree to and you will use  the Flash Screen Warning and the Health and
Safety Warnings (collectively the "Oculus Warnings") and the Oculus VR health and
safety protocols found in the Oculus Best Practices Guide ("Oculus H&S Protocols"),
and your use of the Oculus Warnings and the Oculus end user license agreement
("Oculus EULA") with your Developer Content as provided for in the Oculus Developer
Center, all of which can be found at the following link:
https://developer.oculusvr.com/?action=doc.

2. You, the recipient and user of the RIFT SDK, hereby agree and accept that that
Oculus VR shall own all right, title and interest to the intellectual property
rights, including, but limited to copyright, trademark and patent rights, to any
RIFT SDK Derivatives that you may create, and you hereby assign any and all such
rights to such RIFT SDK Derivatives to Oculus VR, subject to the following.

2.1  We hereby grant to you the a fully paid up, no-charge, royalty-free,

SDK Derivatives solely in conjunction with the RIFT SDK (or any components of the
RIFT SDK) and/or Developer Content on Oculus Rift Products as set forth herein.

2.2  Furthermore, for the sake of clarification, Oculus VR and its assignees and
licensees shall be free to use such RIFT SDK Derivatives without any approval
from you and without compensation or attribution to you.

2.3  You also agree upon Oculus VR's request to provide the source and binary code
of any RIFT SDK Derivatives to Oculus VR. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST

3.1. You may sublicense and redistribute the source, binary, or object code of

or redistribute the source, binary or object code of LibOVR in whole, and you may
not license, sublicense or redistribute any portion or element of LibOVR separately

LibOVR), any RIFT SDK Derivatives, and any Developer Content may only be used

including LibOVR or RIFT SDK Derivatives, a copy of this License as such recipients,

RIFT SDK Derivatives to Oculus VR),  and you must cause any modified files to
carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files;

3.5. If the RIFT SDK or a specific element thereof such as LibOVR includes a
"LICENSE" text file as part of its distribution (the "License Notice"), then
any RIFT SDK Derivatives that you distribute with the RIFT SDK in whole or in
part must include a readable copy of such attribution notices as are contained
within the applicable License Notice file (excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the RIFT SDK Derivatives), in at least one of the following
places: within a License Notice text file distributed as part of the RIFT SDK
Derivatives; within the source form or documentation, if provided along with
the RIFT SDK Derivatives; or, within a display generated by the RIFT SDK Derivatives,
if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.  You must also include
in the License Notice file for all RIFT SDK Derivatives a copy of all notices
(including any product liability or health and safety notices).  The contents
of the License Notice file are for informational purposes only and do not modify
the License. You may add your own attribution notices within RIFT SDK Derivatives
that you distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the License Notice text from
the RIFT SDK or any part thereof, provided that such additional attribution notices
cannot be construed as modifying the License.

3.6. THIS RIFT SDK AND ANY COMPONENT THEREOF IS PROVIDED BY OCULUS VR AND
ITS CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL OCULUS VR AS THE
COPYRIGHT OWNER OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA,
OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS RIFT
SDK OR THE RIFT SDK DERIVATIVES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

4. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or product names of Oculus VR, except as required for reasonable
and customary use in describing the origin of the RIFT SDK, LibOVR, or any
element thereof, and reproducing the content of the License Notice file.

5. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),

deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall Oculus VR
or any contributor be liable to you or your licensees or sublicensees for
damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use
or inability to use the RIFT SDK, LibOVR, any element thereof or any RIFT SDK
Derivatives (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses), even if you or such contributor has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

itself and for all Developer Content created as of March 1, 2014, may be
evidenced by any of the following: your usage of the RIFT SDK or any element
thereof, acceptance of the click-through agreement, or opening the packaging
of the CD-ROM containing the RIFT SDK or any element thereof, including LibOVR.

you agree to abide by and meet all requirements of future updates of this
License for those future RIFT SDK releases as evidenced by the same usage of
the RIFT SDK or any element thereof and the future updates of this License
will apply for that future Developer Content that may developed for or with
that future RIFT SDK or any element thereof (i.e., you cannot sidestep out
of the requirements of future updates of the License by developing against
an older release of the RIFT SDK or License).

7.  Oculus VR reserves the right to terminate this License and all your
rights hereunder in the event you materially breach this License and fail
to cure such breach within ten (10) business days after notice of breach
from Oculus VR.

8.  Furthermore, Oculus VR also reserves the right to cancel or terminate
this License for any of the following reasons upon notice to you, subject
to the appeal process set forth in Section 14 for a wrongful termination:

	a) Intellectual property infringement by you with Developer Content
	or RIFT SDK Derivatives created by you that is used with or by the
	RIFT SDK or any part thereof, or any of the RIFT SDK Derivatives;

	b) Developer Content that violates or infringes upon applicable law;

	c) Health and safety issues associated with your Developer Content;

	d) Failure to comply with or use properly the Oculus Warnings,
	Oculus H&S Protocols, or Oculus EULA;

	e) Use of the RIFT SDK, RIFT SDK Derivatives or LibOVR with a
	commercial product other than an Oculus Approved Product; and

to and acceptance of any such amendments or changes on a going forward basis.

10.   In the event any provision of this License is determined to be invalid,
prohibited or unenforceable by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction,
this License shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable
provision has been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable.

11.   You may not assign any rights or obligations under this License without
the advance written consent of Oculus VR, which may be withheld in its sole
discretion.  Oculus VR may assign its rights or obligations under this License
in its sole discretion.

12.   Failure of either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of
this License will not be construed as a waiver of such provisions or in any way
affect the validity of this License or parts thereof.

13.   Your remedies under this License shall be limited to the right to collect
money damages, if any, and you hereby waive your right to injunctive or other
equitable relief.

14.   This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of California,
without giving effect to choice of law principles.  All disputes relating to
this License shall be resolved by binding non-appearance-based arbitration
before a neutral arbitrator in Orange County, California.  If your License
has been terminated hereunder by Oculus, you may appeal your termination
through this arbitration process on an expedited basis with an arbitration
within thirty days of your giving Oculus VR notice of the appeal.  The
arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures
of JAMS then in effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator shall be final
and capable of entry in any court of competent jurisdiction.  You agree
to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Orange
County, California in connection with any entrance of an arbitrator’s judgment
or decision or any dispute with respect to the arbitration process or procedure
or Oculus VR’s exercise of its equitable rights or remedies.
